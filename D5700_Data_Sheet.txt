D5700 CPU
The D5700 is a computer that I invented for this class. Some of its features include:
8-bit, 500Hz CPU with 16 instructions
4kb of RAM
Read programs from ROM
8x8 ASCII display
ASCII keyboard input
This computer is very limited, but you can still make some very interesting programming that run on it.

Architecture
Registers
The D5700 CPU has 8 general purpose, 8-bit registers ( r0 - r7 ).
It also has 4 special registers

P rogram Counter. A 16-bit register that stores the address of the current instruction.
T imer - an 8-bit register for storing timer value
A ddress - a 16-bit register for storing an address
M emory - a single bit flag that determines whether memory operations should occur on RAM or ROM: 0 for RAM, 1 for ROM

Timer
While the T register is not 0, the CPU decrements the value by 1 at 60hz (every 16ms).

RAM
The D5700 has 4kb of RAM.

ROM
The D5700 reads each instruction from ROM starting at address 0x0. On the physical hardware, ROM would be loaded into the computer via a cartridge.
All D5700 ROM chips are 4kb in size.
The currently running program is terminated with an error if a write operation is attempted on ROM. However, in the future, some cartridges will include writable chips
and the CPU should be future-proof for when that happens.

CPU
The computer executes instructions at 500hz (500 times per second)
The computer reads 2 bytes from ROM every cycle at P and P + 1 and gives them to the CPU to execute. These bytes form the instruction.
This means the P should always be an even number; operations that increment the program counter should increment it by 2

SCREEN
The screen is an 8x8 ASCII display. The screen has 64 bytes of internal RAM that serves as the frame buffer for the ASCII character to display at each position.

Instruction Set
The first nibble of each 2-byte instruction maps to one of the instructions. There are 16 instructions in total.
Each instruction does the following:
1. Splits the bytes up into the registers, address, bytes etc... required by the operation
2. Performs the operation
3. (Optional) increments the program counter.
Use the following to understand each instruction:
rX = register, a value 0-7
bb = a byte
aaa = an address
ALL NUMBERS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS BASE-16 NUMBERS

STORE (0, rX, bb)
Stores byte bb in register r
Example 00FF - stores the value FF in register 0

ADD (1, rX, rY, rZ)
Adds the value in rX to the value in rY and stores in rZ
Example 1010 - adds the values in r0 and r1 and stores in r0

SUB (2, rX, rY, rZ)
Adds the value in rY from the value in rX and stores in rZ .
Example 2010 - subtracts the value in r1 from r0 and stores in r0

READ (3, rX, 00)
Reads the value in memory at the address stored in A and store in register rX ;
Reads from ROM if M = 1
Example 3700 stores the value in memory at address A and store in r7 .

WRITE (4, rX, 00)
Writes the value in rX to memory at the address stored in A .
Will attempt to write to ROM if M = 1. This will fail for most ROM chips. But, some ROMs have a writable chips. For future proofing, the instruction should attempt to
write to ROM.
Example 4300 - stores the value in r3 in memory at address A

JUMP (5, aaa)
Sets P to the value of aaa
Terminates the program with an error if aaa is not divisible by 2.
Program counter is not incremented after this instruction.
Example 51F2 - sets the program counter to 1F2

READ_KEYBOARD (6, rX, 00)
Pauses the program and waits for keyboard input. Only the base-16 digits 0-F are allowed as input. Input should be parsed as a number and stored in rX. Only up to 2
digits (one byte) are read, the rest are ignored. Stores 0 if input is the empty string.
Example 6200 - stores the number the user typed in r2

SWITCH_MEMORY (7000)
Toggles the M register - sets to 1 if M is 0 and sets to 0 if M is 1.

SKIP_EQUAL (8, rX, rY, 0)
Compares the values in rX and rY and skips the next instruction if they are equal.
Example 8120 - compares r1 with r2 and skips the next instruction if they are equal.

SKIP_NOT_EQUAL (9, rX, rY, 0)
Compares the values in rX and rY and skips the next instruction if they are NOT equal.
Example 9120 - compares r1 with r2 and skips the next instruction if they are NOT equal.

SET_A (A, aaa)
Sets the value of A to be aaa .
Example A255 - sets A to be 255.

SET_T (B, bb, 0)
Sets the value of T top be bb .
Example B0A0 - sets T to be 0A (or just A).

READ_T (C, rX, 00)
Reads the value of T and stores in rX .
Example C000 - reads T and stores in r0

CONVERT_TO_BASE_10 (D, rX, 00)
Converts the byte stored in rX to base-10 and stores the 100s digit in A the, 10s digit in A+1 and the 1s digit in A+2 .
Example D200 - converts value r2 and stores the digits in A , A + 1 , and A+2 .

CONVERT_BYTE_TO_ASCII (E, rX, rY, 0)
Takes the digit (0-F) stored in rX and converts it to the ASCII value for the digit and stores it in rY
Terminates the program with an error if the byte stored in rX is greater than F (base-16)
Example E010 - Takes the value in r0 and stores the ASCII value in r1 .

DRAW (F, rX, rY, rZ)
Draws the ASCII character for the byte stored in rX at row rY , and column rZ to the screen. (Row and column are 0 based.)
It accomplishes this by writing the ASCII character to the screens internal RAM. rY and rZ are converted to the address in the RAM before writing.
Terminates the program with an error if the value in rX is > 7F (127 in base-10)
Example F123 - draws the ASCII character stored in r1 at row r2 and column r3
